# vanilla-website

## ABOUT
The goal of this project is to build a simple website completely from scratch, so that Crashcode students can read, reference, and experiment with a working model of a website.

## GETTING STARTED
To set the project up, look at the green `clone or download` button for this repository. You can:

1) Download the .zip file, uncompress the file on your computer, then open the file in your editor.

2) Open your terminal window and clone the repository with the following commands:

    1) Navigate to your root directory: `cd ~/Desktop/projects`
    2) Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/crashcodeschool/vanilla-website.git`
    3) Open the directory in your text editor

Note: If you do not have git and github set up on your computer yet, step 2 will not work. I recommend step 1, unless you're very focused on getting familiar with git.

## TECHNOLOGIES USED
The website will be built with plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. No frameworks or libraries.

The only other tools involved are Google Fonts and FontAwesome, which are both loaded through a CDN.


## CONCEPT
A prototype can be found on [InVision](https://invis.io/9PN0KSEVCF8#/307597765_v1-Home-1-)
